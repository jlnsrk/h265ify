# h265ify

# About
Is an Microsoft Edge(C) extension which allows users to actually use the already present support for h265/hevc. Microsoft Edge(C) already
has builtin support for hevc but doesn't report it to websites which in turn results in hevc videos not being played. Especially with
webbased mediacenters such as plex or emby this will lead to unnecesary transcoding.

# Requirements
Microsoft Edge
HEVC Codec pack from Microsoft Store(C)( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hevc-video-extensions-from-device-manufacturer/9n4wgh0z6vhq )

# Installation
Install like you would any other extension

# Remarks
h265ify is based on the work of https://github.com/erkserkserks
